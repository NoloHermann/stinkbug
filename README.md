# stinkbug
A collection of the code used to visualise readings from sensors and train a neural network to identify the presence of a stinkbug's alarm pheromones

The data was gathered using an array of metal-oxide sensors and exposing them to different gasses, logging the specific concentrations and types of gasses, along with the times they were exposed. This data was used to build and train a neural network upon which the device could measure and classify when the presence of a stinkbug's alarm pheromones are present in the atmosphere.
